# Flashcards-Interface
An Interface for "Flashcards Deluxe" (Android/I-app). Easy offline flashcards-creating without a browser or calculating-tools.

To start the tool, Python3 and Python-tk is needed, as it is written as a python3 tool using tkinter.

At the moment only Linux is supported, Windows support will be added soon.

The tool creates a file, which content can simply be copy-and-pasted into the upload-mask on http://orangeorapple.com/Flashcards/
